### Project description

In this project the idea was to build a model able to classify images, and to be more precise, the images themselves and not the pixels, or specific features in the images. A dataset of scenes/landscapes images was choosed because of its possible link to geography, and provided by Intel on Kaggle. A deep learning model, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) was choosed because they usually work well for image classification because of how they're built. Different numbers and organisations of layers were tried, and each time the accuracies (training and validation) were compared. Eventually the best model's results were displayed with a confusion matrix

Steps of the project :
- Importation of the images and labels separated ; from 2 folders we get test images/labels and train images/labels
- Train images/labels are then separated in train images/labels and validation images labels 
      => we end up with test, train and validation datasets
- Number of images per datasets and classes are then shown on an horizontal barplot
-
